# Ants, or something
###### Compete, with ants, against ants.

## What?

*Ants, or something* is a project made for educational purpose. The goal was to do crowd interactions so I used lots of ants!

## Controls

Playing with a controller is recommended, but you can also play with the arrow keys or WASD.
